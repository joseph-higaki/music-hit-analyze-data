# Predicting a hit Song - Analyze Data

This contains the [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com/) we used to understand and analyze the variables from the datasets.
This allowed us to get an idea of:
* Correlated and uncorrelated features
* Detect outliers and assess a treatment for them
* Detect dirty/missing data

Using Machine Learning Models to predict a song's popularity.
This is a [group](#team) project from the Data Science and Advanced Analytics course from the Big Data &amp; Analytics Masters @ [EAE](https://www.eae.es/) class of 2021.
